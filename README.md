 Algorithm of determining the optimum solution utilizing the SFS γ˜OSs
 
Step-1: Formulate the results given by expert for each object into SFS S. 

Step-2: Frame the SFS T S. 

Step-3: Based on the primary attribute requirement define a suitable operation for the given problem.

Step-4: Determine SFS γ˜OSs .

Step-5: Consider the SFS γ˜OS which is the union of the primary SFS Ss contained in the collection τΩγ˜.

Step-6: Compute the comparison table. 

Step-7: Find the score Si

Step-8: The optimal solution is chosen by calculating the highest score.
